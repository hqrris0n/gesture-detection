## Download
After downloading the files from here, it is recommended to create a python virtual environment, but it is not necessary. Import the jupyter notebook library into environment.

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

## Usage
Open terminal, and open your virtual environment if you have one. Then run jupyter notebook with the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Within jupyter notebook, you can run each cell from top to bottom with the run button or `[Shift]` + `[Enter]`. All the code down to "Camera Testing" is necessary for the program to run as is. 

If there are camera problems, the "Camera Testing" section may be able to help.

To quit the program, press `Q` on the camera window. Make sure the next cell is queued to run for it to completely close.
